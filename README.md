Custom PHP rendering package for the Laravel 5 framework - developed by [Ixudra](http://ixudra.be).

This package provides several utility methods that allow you to easily display several pieces of information such as dates, prices and much more. All of these representations can be configured depending on the locale of the user. This gives you the ability to display data in a way that is most desirable for your users without difficulty.

This package can be used by anyone at any given time, but keep in mind that it is optimized for my personal custom workflow. It may not suit your project perfectly and modifications may be in order.

## Installation

Pull this package in through Composer.

```js

    {
        "require": {
            "ixudra/render": "1.*"
        }
    }

```

or run in terminal: `composer require ixudra/render`

### Laravel 5.5+ Integration

Laravel's package discovery will take care of integration for you.


### Laravel 5.* Integration

Add the service provider to your `config/app.php` file:

```php

    'providers'     => array(

        //...
        Ixudra\Render\RenderServiceProvider::class,

    ),

```

Add the facade to your app.php file

```php

    'facades'       => array(

        //...
        'Render'        => Ixudra\Render\Facades\Render::class,

    ),

```



## Usage

Once all dependencies have been included and migrations have been run, you can start using the package:

```php

    // Set the locale of the rendering engine so you don't have to repeat it all the time. This will remain set until manually changed
    Render::setLocale('en');


    // Translate the message in the app default app locale
    Render::translate('your.key.goes.here');

    // Translate the message recursively in a given locale - see [ixudra/translations](https://github.com/ixudra/translation) for details on recursive translations
    Render::recursive('admin.menu.title.new', array('model' => 'user'), true, $locale);


    // Display a date in the default app locale 
    Render::date( '02/06/15', 'd/m/y' );

    // Display a date in a specific locale 
    Render::date( '02/06/15', 'd/m/y', 'en' );


    // Display a value as currency in the default app locale 
    Render::currency( 5123.6598 );              // Returns â‚¬ 5.123,65

    // Display a value as currency in a specific locale - COMING SOON
    Render::currency( 5123.6598, 'us' );        // Returns $ 5.123,65

```



That's all there is to it! Have fun!
